This code is ready to run, but the database isn't attached. The code includes functionalities for user authentication, data processing, and report generation. It has been tested in a local environment. However, you will need to set up and attach the database for it to work correctly.

The database schema includes tables for users, roles, permissions, and activity logs. It is designed to be highly scalable and secure, with optimized indexes for fast data retrieval. If you need the database, please contact me for further instructions and a copy of the database file.

Thank you, Aprio Anggata
